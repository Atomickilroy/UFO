# UFO - JavaScript / Web Application & Visualizations

## Overview of Project

#### - *This project was an introduction into JavaScript and creating Web Visualizations. Starting this project from a simple storyboard sketch to this revision was an awesome journey in an of itself. The goal was to build an HTML table that contained UFO Sighting Data complete with filtering capablities. To then surround that table with interactive user friendly features and displays that the user could explore. Say by, interacting with the table filters or enjoying an interesting article about UFO's. To present data in a way that felt ironically iterstellar.* 

## Purpose

**The purpose of this project was to start learning tools that work hand and hand web visulatizations:**
   - Dev Console  , VSCode
  - Beautifulsoup, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  - Learn how to build a interactive HTML table using JS loops
  - Understand how JavaScript, HTML and CSS- Connect / Interact 
      - to display data, images, tables on a web page 
  - Use Bootstrap/CSS to polish up our webpage

## Summary: 
 This project provided great insight into what all goes into building and developing a webpage with visualtization. With that said it also had its holes. 
  - One, the data set wasnt that realiable in that it, only had data for 2010 and ultimately was still kind of hard to "read" even with the filters. 
  - Two, the web page itself offered no reason for the reader to return or an easy way to share it with others. 
  
  Furture revisions could incoropated the last 70 years of sightings, opposed to just the one year. There could be a heat map with a feature that could plot sightings on interactive world map based on the user input. For those users that were looking for a better visual of the consentrations of sitings or those looking to take it a step further and to hunt of a UFO. For what it is though, its still a great way to display the limited data in a visually appealing way.
